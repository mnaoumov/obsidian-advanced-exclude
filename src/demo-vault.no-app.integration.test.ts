// Keeps the in-repo `demo-vault/` in sync with the plugin's public surface WITHOUT
// launching Obsidian: it reflects the real config from source and asserts every
// setting is documented in a note, and that the guard note/member still exist
// (rename drift). Advanced Exclude's feature surface is driven entirely through its
// settings tab, so only the PluginSettings config class is reflected; the plugin's
// runtime behavior is covered by the other integration tests.
