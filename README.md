# Advanced Exclude

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that enhances the `Excluded files` setting bringing `gitignore` syntax.

Obsidian has `Files and links > Excluded files` setting, but it is not as useful, because the excluded files are still present in the `Files` pane, appear in `Backlinks` pane, etc.

The plugin adds the following features:

- Configure ignore patterns using [`gitignore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) syntax.
- `.obsidianignore` file for manual editing.
- Support ignore patterns from `.gitignore` file.
- Reuse existing `Files and links > Excluded files` setting in string/regexp format.
