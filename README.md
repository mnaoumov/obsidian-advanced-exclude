# Advanced Exclude

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that enhances the `Excluded files` setting.

Obsidian has `Files and links > Excluded files` setting, but it is not as useful, because the excluded files are still present in the `Files` pane, appear in `Backlinks` pane, etc.

This plugin improves the setting allowing Excluded files to be truly excluded.

Additionally, it allows to have a separate configuration using [`gitignore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) syntax.

You can also edit the configuration file `.obsidianignore` manually.
