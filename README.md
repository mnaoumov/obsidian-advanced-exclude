# Advanced Exclude

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that enhances the `Excluded files` setting bringing `gitignore` syntax.

Obsidian has `Files and links > Excluded files` setting, but it is not as useful, because the excluded files are still present in the `Files` pane, appear in `Backlinks` pane, etc.

The plugin adds the following features:

- Configure ignore patterns using [`gitignore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) syntax.
- `.obsidianignore` file for manual editing.
- Support ignore patterns from `.gitignore` file.
- Reuse existing `Files and links > Excluded files` setting in string/regexp format.

> [!WARNING]
>
> The plugin makes Obsidian behave like the ignored files do not exist. This might affect features like [`Obsidian Sync`](https://help.obsidian.md/sync), [`Obsidian Publish`](https://help.obsidian.md/publish), etc.
>
> Ensure you configured the plugin correctly to avoid data loss.
